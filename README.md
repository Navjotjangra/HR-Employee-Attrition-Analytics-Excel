# HR Analytics Dashboard: Employee Engagement & Attrition Insights

This repository contains an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel. The project analyzes a fictional company's employee dataset to uncover key drivers of attrition and provide actionable insights for improving employee retention.


#üìù Project Overview

Employee attrition is a significant cost for any organization. This project aims to move beyond simply reporting the attrition rate by creating a dynamic tool that allows HR stakeholders to explore and understand the complex factors that contribute to employees leaving the company. The dashboard serves as a strategic tool to identify at-risk employee groups and inform targeted retention strategies.

# ‚ùì Problem Statement

The primary goal was to answer these critical business questions:
* Which employee segments (by department, tenure, salary, etc.) are most at risk of attrition?
* What is the relationship between job satisfaction, work-life balance, and an employee's decision to stay or leave?
* Where should the company strategically focus its retention efforts for the most significant impact?

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel:
    * Data Cleaning and Preparation
    * Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts for Data Analysis
    * Calculated Fields for creating new metrics
    * Interactive Dashboard Creation with Slicers

#üí° Key Insights & Actionable Recommendations

# 1. üîç The Revolving Door: Early Tenure Attrition
* Insight: The highest rate of attrition is heavily concentrated among employees with lower salary bands and those within their first 1-3 years at the company.
* Recommendation: Implement a more robust onboarding program and a structured 1-year review process. Creating a clear path for salary growth and career development for junior employees can significantly improve early-career retention.

# 2. üòû The Satisfaction-Attrition Link
* Insight: There is a clear, inverse correlation between average job satisfaction and attrition rates. The Sales department, in particular, shows both high attrition and low job satisfaction.
* Recommendation: Conduct targeted exit interviews and regular pulse surveys within the Sales department to identify and address the specific pain points causing dissatisfaction, such as workload, compensation structure, or management.

# 3. üéì The Mismatch Signal
* Insight: Attrition rates vary significantly by education field, which suggests that some employees may be in roles that do not fully utilize their skills or align with their academic background.
* Recommendation: Refine the job description and screening process during hiring to ensure a better alignment between a candidate's qualifications and the role's day-to-day responsibilities. This can lead to higher job satisfaction and longer tenure.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Dashboard Features

The dashboard is fully interactive and allows for dynamic filtering of the data. Key features include:
* KPI Cards: At-a-glance view of Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Average Job Satisfaction, etc.
* Interactive Slicers: Dynamically filter the entire dashboard by:
    * Job Role
    * Education
    * Department
    * Overtime
    * Gender
